[{"author":null,"categories":["tips"],"content":"Authoring mathematical and chemical equations Cleanwhite theme now has built-in KaTeX\\KaTeXKATE​X support, so that you can easily include complex mathematical formulae into your web page, either inline or centred on its own line. The theme uses Hugo\u0026amp;rsquo;s embedded instance of the KaTeX display engine to render mathematical markup to HTML at build time. With this server side rendering of formulae, the same output is produced, regardless of your browser or your environment.\nLaTeX\\LaTeXLATE​X is a high-quality typesetting system for the production of technical and scientific documentation. Due to its excellent math typesetting capabilities, TeX\\TeXTE​X became the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents, especially if these documents contain a lot of mathematical formulae. Designed and mostly written by Donald Knuth, the initial version was released in 1978.

Here is a live demo site using this theme.\nIt is based on huxblog Jekyll Theme and Clean Blog Jekyll Theme.\nThese two upstream projects have done awesome jobs to create a blog theme, what I\u0026amp;rsquo;m doing here is porting it to Hugo, of which I like the simplicity and the much faster compiling speed. Some other features which I think could be useful, such as site search with algolia and proxy for Disqus access in China, have also been built in the CleanWhite theme. Other fancy features of upstream projects are not supported by this Hugo theme, I\u0026amp;rsquo;d like to make it as simple as possible and only focus on blog purpose, at least for now. While I created this theme, I followed the Hugo theme best practice and tried to make every part of the template as a replaceable partial html, so it could be much easier for you to make your customization based on it.\nScreenshots Home Post Search …","date":1546992e3,"dir":"post/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":1100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546992e3,"objectID":"2f05902e7435de187bb5303fb74f55e2","permalink":"https://jasonw66.github.io/blog/post/readme/","publishdate":"2019-01-09T00:00:00Z","readingtime":3,"relpermalink":"/blog/post/readme/","section":"post","tags":null,"title":"Clean White Theme for Hugo","type":"post","url":"/blog/post/readme/","weight":0,"wordcount":1083},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":"About Me Jason Wang\n","date":-62135596800,"dir":"about/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"https://jasonw66.github.io/blog/about/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/blog/about/","section":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page","url":"/blog/about/","weight":0,"wordcount":4},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"dir":"notes/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"1ede8046f9c3a02d422dea7bbf324e64","permalink":"https://jasonw66.github.io/blog/notes/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/blog/notes/","section":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page","url":"/blog/notes/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"dir":"search/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8946788897930c0c0c39fbfcd30ff2e4","permalink":"https://jasonw66.github.io/blog/search/placeholder/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/blog/search/placeholder/","section":"search","tags":null,"title":"","type":"search","url":"/blog/search/placeholder/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"dir":"archive/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":"Archive of historical posts.","keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"a06e5ce9eca4c3260843078104889780","permalink":"https://jasonw66.github.io/blog/archive/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/blog/archive/","section":"","tags":null,"title":"Posts Archive","type":"archive","url":"/blog/archive/","weight":0,"wordcount":0}]
